# Motion-detector-using-webcam
Detects moving objects using webcam and can record the time when object enters and leaves.

Videos can be treated as stack of pictures called frames. Here I am comparing different frames(pictures) to the first frame which should be static(No movements initially). We compare two images by comparing the intensity value of each pixels.
